# CSS names and conventions

## General

### backdrop

back drop means when the window is open but not focused, for example consider program A and B are open side by side (or in any other formation with only one limation, both should be visible on screen), if you click on program A it will be focused and program B becomes *backdroped*, its visual (usually) gets grayed out to indicate it is not focused.
